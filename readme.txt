    A manual is available online:

Compiling

    Any C++ compiler should work.

    To build the GUI, you need Qt.

    To build the command line tool, PCRE is needed. More information about PCRE is found in
    build.txt

    There are multiple compilation choices:
      * qmake - cross platform build tool
      * Visual Studio - Windows
      * gnu make
      * g++

    qmake
    =====
        You can use the gui/gui.pro file to build the GUI.
            cd gui
            qmake
            make

    Visual Studio
    =============
        Use the cppcheck.sln file.

    gnu make
    ========
        make

    g++ (for experts)
    =================
        If you just want to build Cppcheck then you can use this command:
            g++ -o cppcheck -lpcre -Ilib -Iexternals cli/*.cpp lib/*.cpp externals/tinyxml/*.cpp
    mingw
    =====
        make LDFLAGS=-lshlwapi

Cross compiling Win32 (CLI) version of Cppcheck in Linux

    sudo apt-get install mingw32
    make CXX=i586-mingw32msvc-g++ LDFLAGS="-lshlwapi"
    mv cppcheck cppcheck.exe
