
Some temporary build instructions. This is work in progress.


The tinyxml and pcre libraries are needed. The tinyxml is not really needed, these
files could be integrated into the CLI instead.


Windows

Visual Studio

To build pcre I downloaded the sourcecode from www.pcre.org. I downloaded cmake 2.8.
Then I built the lib with:
    cmake .
    nmake

To build tinyxml I just built all the files in externals/tinyxml


MINGW (Qt 4.7 SDK)

I downloaded pcre-8.0-lib.zip from here: http://software-download.name/pcre-library-windows/

I build libtinyxml.a with:
    cd externals/tinyxml
    qmake
    jom


Linux

The normal Makefile should work

Install pcre on ubuntu might be needed:
sudo apt-get install libpcre3 libpcre3-dev
