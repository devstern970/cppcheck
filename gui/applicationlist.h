/**

* Each application has a name and a path. Name is displayed to the user
* and has no other meaning. It isn't used to start the application.
* Path contains the path to the application as well as the executable itself and
* any possible argument user might want to specify.
*
* User can also specify certain predefined strings to path. These strings
* will be replaced with appropriate values concerning the error. Strings are:
* (file) - Filename containing the error
* (line) - Line number containing the error
* (message) - Error message
* (severity) - Error severity
*
* Example opening a file with Kate and make Kate scroll to the correct line:
* kate -l(line) (file)
