<h1>Cppcheck</h1>

<p>Cppcheck is an analysis tool for C/C++ code. Unlike C/C++ compilers and many other analysis tools, we don't detect syntax errors. Cppcheck only detects the types of bugs that the compilers normally fail to detect. The goal is no false positives.</p>

<p>We recommend that you enable as many warnings as possible in your compiler. If you use GCC: take a look at <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Warning-Options.html">Warning options - using GCC</a>.</p>

<h2>Supported platforms</h2>
Cppcheck is versatile:
<ul>
  <li>You can check non-standard code that includes various compiler extensions, inline assembly code, etc.</li>
  <li>Cppcheck is supposed to be compilable by any C++ compiler which handles the latest C++ standard.</li>
  <li>Cppcheck is supposed to work on any platform that has sufficient cpu and memory.</li>
</ul>
